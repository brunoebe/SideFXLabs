""" Generates work-items based on imageplanes found in an image """

This node generates work-items based on imageplanes found in an image. This is very useful to for example loop over imageplanes found in an image and run them through a cop network to extract them.

@parameters
    == Settings ==
    Image:
        The path used to load the image from.
    Attribute Name:
        The attribute name on the work-items that are being created to store the imageplane name in.
    Inherit Upstream Workitems:
        Enabling this when the node has input work-items will make the generated work-items use those inputs as parents.
