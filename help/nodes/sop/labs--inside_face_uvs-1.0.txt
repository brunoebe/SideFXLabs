""" Create UV's for inside faces of voronoi fractured geometry. """

:video:
    #src:/movies/insideuvs.mp4

Voronoi fracture can generate interior faces, but won't create uv's. The Inside Face UVs HDA will generate automatic uv's for these interior faces.

The only requirement is that 'inside' and 'outside' groups have been defined by the voronoi fracture sop, which is the default behavior.

@parameters
    Group:
        A subset of primitives to apply the operation to.
    == UV ==
    Inside Group:
        The group the operation should be applied to.
    Attribute:
        The attribute name to be used for generating UVs for.
    Tiling:
        Amount of uv space to use; 1 will use the 0-1 range, 2 will use 0-2 etc.
    Flattening Method:
        How to flatten 3d geometry into uv space, see the 'UV flatten' sop help for details.

    == Normals ==
    Compute Normals:
        Toggle if new normals should be generated for the specified inside group.
    Cusp Angle:
        The cusp angle to be used when generating normals.
    Weighting Method:
        The weighting method to be used when generating normals.
