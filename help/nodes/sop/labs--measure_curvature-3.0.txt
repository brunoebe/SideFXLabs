""" Generates Point Colors based on the Curvature of the Model """

Measures the Curvature of a model and outputs it as Point Colors. 

Handy for all types of calculations, including scattering and polyreduction. Curvature is one of the fundamental mesh properties and is generally useful. 

By Default, green will represent Convex colors and Red will represent Concave colors. Unless `Single Color` is set. 

TIP:
    By default the color differences when using `Single Color` can be quite subtle. To really see the colors well, change the viewport lighting mode to disable lighting.

@parameters
    == Curvature Values ==
    Method:
        Dropdown with several algorithms (some provided by community user Petz) 
    Voxel Size:
        For Voxel based calculations, adjust the size of the voxel grid
    Export Color:
        Export the concave and convex attributes as color attribute (`Cd`) as well.
    Single Color:
        Export a monochrome color containing both concave and convex values centered around a 0.5 grey value.
    Per Piece:
        Calculate curvature per named piece. Doing so on wildly different pieces of geometry (for example scale) will calculate the curvature independently from eachother and produce better results overall.
    Piece Attribute:
        The primitive attribute to be used for looping over geometry internally.

    == Convex Adjustment ==
    Attribute:
	The point attribute to be created to store the curvature values in. 
    Intensity:
        A multiplier on the calculated curvature values. Could also be seen as "gain", and will help accentuate curvature.
    Blur Amount:
        Blurs the calculated curvature values on neighboring points to produce a more smooth result.
    Remap Range:
        Ramp used to remap the linear 0-1 values calculated internally to. This is useful to artistically control the range of output values.
