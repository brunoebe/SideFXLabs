""" This tool allows you to run geometry through InstantMeshes and generate a quad mesh. """

The InstantMeshes sop takes in geometry through its primary input, and will then run it through the InstantMeshes algorithm to generate a new quad mesh.

@parameters
    Cook:
        Force a manual recook of the node.
    Manual Mode:
        Enabling this will prevent the node from recooking automatically on input geometry changes, or changes made to the parameters. Useful for freezing a result.
    == Mesh Options ==
    Desired Polygon Count:
        Allows you to specify the desired polycount. By default this controls the number of generated points, but when Quad Dominant is toggled on, this controls the number of quads.
    Quad Dominant:
	Generate a tri/quad dominant mesh instead of a pure tri/quad mesh.
    Deterministic:
        Controls if the meshing should be deterministic.
    Crease Angle:
        Specifies the maximum generated Crease Angle used when deciding where to place edge loops.
    == Executable ==
    Instant Meshes:
        This should point to the executable of Instant Meshes, which you can download from the Github repo found when clicking Download Instant Meshes button.
    Download Instant Meshes:
        This will open the browser and go to the Instant Meshes repo where you can download the required executables.
    == Advanced ==
    Instant Meshes Cache:
        The location where the cache should be written to from Instant Meshes.
    Houdini Cache:
        The location where the cache should be written to from Houdini.
    Hide Dialog:
        Enabling this hides the commandline dialog that pops up on Windows.
